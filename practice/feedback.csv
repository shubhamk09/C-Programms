Also, try to give spaces between the code lines to differentiate between one working part and the other. Like separate the scanf function and next print function with a line gap(especially in main fn), just like you have given space after #include to separate it from the body. It makes the code look neat and clean and doesn't give a heartattack (as we will have to see and understand such long code.. so it's better to focus elsewhere) :) If any of my comments were vulgar or if i shouldn't have said then sorry for that. No offense pls :) :) Also i dont know much about the doxygen and if the code ran on both linux and windows. So i'm putting more improvement here.",No test cases were found. Use of nested switch with so many printf functions were there.  Please try to change the images to the imagesAndVideos folder and let the dataset remain in the others part. Also usage of functions were not clear. In High Level Requirement try to just add it as a small single line or short brief topic so that people can understand what all topics are included. Low Level requirements were correctly done.  Since there was no test case found i assume you haven't tested all those valgrind and others so the link is not there. And Architecture spelling is wrong :). Btw it was design folder and not architecture. And yes u forgot to add the comment lines.
